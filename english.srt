00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,090
JANUARY 17, 2096

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Is he to the right?

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,620
Or the left?

4
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,830
"KYUCHOJI TEMPLE"

5
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,870
Boy, you had me on the ropes.

6
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,660
Master, what was that just now?

7
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,870
I didn't think you would break
my Cocoon Water Mirage.

8
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,160
That wasn't one of your
usual illusion arts, was it?

9
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,490
You realized that?

10
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,700
That odd ability of yours to read a spell
at a glance is a true threat to your opponent.

11
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,120
But there's a way to use it against you.

12
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Was it the illusion you just used?

13
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,950
Cocoon Water Mirage is a spell designed
to deceive the eyes of things not of this world.

14
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,290
Master, you just said...
"the eyes of things not of this world"?

15
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,660
It's not only humans we're up against.

16
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,870
In fact, it's not rare
to fight supernatural things.

17
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,410
But my friend, an Ancient Magic user,

18
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,450
said that encountering actual demons
was an extremely rare thing.

19
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,990
You've already had
one or two experiences yourself.

20
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,330
The magic you modern
magicians call "SB Magic"...

21
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,700
What does it use as a medium?

22
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,200
I think you understand.

23
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,040
What you modern magicians
call "spiritual beings"

24
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,240
or "spirits" are not of this world.

25
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,740
So, these spirits that are nothing more
than independent information bodies

26
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,540
cut off from phenomena
are not of this world?

27
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,870
To be precise, they might be better called
"things without life or flesh."

28
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,910
Master, can I ask you one more question?

29
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,490
Go ahead.

30
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,490
According to Modern Magic,

31
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,660
spirits are independent information bodies
derived from natural phenomena.

32
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,620
Then, if parasites can feed off
a person's ethereal body

33
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,200
and change the person's properties,

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,290
what information bodies
would they be based on?

35
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:44,080
I don't know the origin of these
wraiths or what you call "parasites."

36
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,830
They interfere with people's minds,

37
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,580
so I'd think they're based
in spirit phenomena.

38
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,790
Information organisms
originating in the mind?

39
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,620
Just as spirits originating
in physical phenomena

40
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,540
drift through a shadow world
back-to-back with this one,

41
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,120
the wraiths originating
in mental phenomena

42
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,660
might come from the shadow world
back-to-back with our mental world.

43
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,450
That's my own unadulterated theory.

44
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,490
Sorry to call out of the blue, Shizuku.

45
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,660
That's okay. What's up?

46
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,330
Um, Tatsuya wants to ask you something.
I'll let you talk to him.

47
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,540
Sorry to call you so late.

48
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,870
I was going to send you an email at first,

49
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,490
but it's easier to make myself
clear talking face-to-face.

50
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,370
No problem. It's only 8 PM here.

51
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,620
So, what is it?

52
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,830
Honoka mentioned that a vampire is
making a mess of things over there, too.

53
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,620
I'd like you to fill me in
on any details you have.

54
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,660
It's still just treated
as an urban legend in America.

55
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,830
Or at least, the media doesn't cover it.

56
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,490
Has something happened there?

57
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,290
Something like a vampire attacked Leo.

58
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,160
What?

59
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,620
Don't worry. He'll be okay.
Leo drove off the vampire personally.

60
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,160
But he happened to take damage
from their strange ability,

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,160
and he's recuperating in the hospital.

62
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Thank goodness.

63
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,040
I see. That's why you want to know
what's happening here.

64
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
Yeah.

65
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,370
But you don't have to investigate.

66
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,330
Whatever you can find
from asking around is fine.

67
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,660
But you think America has some clues, right?

68
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,540
Sort of, but to be honest...

69
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,540
I believe the criminal behind the
vampire incident came here from America.

70
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,450
So, I really want you to stay away
from anything dangerous.

71
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,240
Don't take any chances, Shizuku.

72
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,790
Okay. I'll play it safe.

73
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,160
So, be patient and don't expect much.

74
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,160
JANUARY 20, 2096 / UDAGAWACHO, SHIBUYA WARD

75
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,620
Miki, which way?

76
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,620
This way, huh?

77
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,700
I really think it'd be better
to team up with Jumonji and Saegusa.

78
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Miki!

79
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,540
Let's go!

80
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,410
Coming!

81
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Which way, Silvie?

82
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,870
Right at the next corner, Commander!

83
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,120
Roger that!

84
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,080
Claire, Rachel, head Sullivan off!

85
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,870
Yes, ma'am!

86
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,540
I can't stop this dagger
that's been activated with a movement spell!

87
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,200
She's out of my league--

88
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,580
Miki, you take the one in the coat!
I'll bring down the masked one!

89
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,580
I'm your opponent.

90
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,620
How fast is she?

91
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,290
Here I come!

92
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,160
Her swordsmanship is first-rate.

93
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,080
Her magic abilities are top-notch.

94
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,620
Other than bruises,
Leo didn't have any physical wounds.

95
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,120
Then...

96
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
this creep either used
a blunt weapon or bare hands.

97
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
In that case...

98
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,950
Bridal Veil!

99
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,160
A barrier? Or weakening?

100
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,040
A barrier! Then, Thunder Child!

101
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,830
You're mine!

102
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,950
Strange. The flash should only be
for a second, but it's still there.

103
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,580
Don't tell me...

104
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,040
Emission-Type Magic?

105
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,700
I won't make it!

106
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,660
Tatsuya?

107
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
I have the data
of the colors and contours,

108
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,370
but all other information is missing.

109
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,620
What is this?

110
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,490
She escaped.

111
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,020
VISITOR ARC III

112
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,120
Did you retrieve Sergeant Sullivan's body?

113
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,580
Yes, we have it.

114
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,910
And have you determined the identity
of the other one I was pursuing?

115
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,790
I'm sorry.

116
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,580
We successfully extracted
the Psi-wave pattern,

117
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,330
but it didn't match any of the data.

118
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,830
Not a fugitive, then?

119
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,990
Or the Psi-wave patterns
have been altered.

120
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,830
My guess is the latter.

121
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,370
Understood.

122
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,490
Trace the pattern we picked up.

123
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,080
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,950
Nobody told me Erika was that strong!

125
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:08,740
And Tatsuya used some crazy skill
or magic to disable my spells!

126
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,950
Are all high schoolers in Japan like that?

127
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,580
Aunt...

128
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,120
I apologize for calling so late.

129
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,910
It's fine. But unusual
for you to call me, Tatsuya.

130
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:35,410
Actually, there's one thing I'd like
to ask you and one request I wish to make.

131
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,330
Ask away.

132
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,790
Then, if I may...

133
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:50,160
Aunt Maya, would you please tell me
how the Kudou Family's Parade spell works?

134
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,160
Oh my, Tatsuya...

135
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,740
Parade is the Kudou Family's secret technique.

136
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,120
Why would you think
I'd know its mysteries?

137
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,290
You studied under
General Kudou for a time, Aunt.

138
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,330
Even if you don't know the magic sequence,
maybe you know the gist.

139
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,870
Is the anti-magic spell Parade
for duplicating and processing parts

140
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,790
related to your own Eidos'
outward appearance...

141
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,200
then projecting it onto yourself to
temporarily alter your physical appearance

142
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,740
while also substituting any magical
interference aims with their own disguised Eidos

143
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,870
to block the usage of magic
on your real body?

144
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:47,910
I had thought you, of all people, would know
that transformation magic is impossible.

145
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,870
If all you want to do
is alter your appearance,

146
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,160
you can do it by using Light Interference-Type
Magic, though it's not true transformation.

147
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,540
The issue lies in that Light Interference-Type
Magic can't fool my eyes.

148
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,620
Brother, you don't mean that there was someone

149
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,290
who could keep their
identity secret from you, right?

150
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,290
That's not all.

151
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,660
It caused my Mist Dispersion to miss.

152
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,450
How?

153
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,660
Even if Mist Dispersion didn't work,

154
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Trident should've been no problem.

155
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,080
Aunt, it seems that this case
is more than we can handle.

156
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,080
So, I would like to request reinforcements.

157
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,330
Very well. Things seem to be shifting
past the scope of our expectations.

158
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,870
I give you permission
to contact Major Kazama.

159
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,790
Thank you.

160
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,040
Oh, that's right, Tatsuya...

161
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,790
I do recall hearing
that the Old Master's younger brother...

162
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,910
was more skilled at using
Parade than he was.

163

JANUARY 21, 2096

164
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,910
CROSSFIELD

165
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,910
ROOM 2

166
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,910
CLUB

167
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,080
I apologize for asking you here.
I know you're busy.

168
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,290
Not at all. But what can I do for you?

169
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,990
Do you know that based
upon the Ten Master Clans' decision,

170
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:23,490
the Saegusa Family and Jumonji Family are
cooperating to investigate the vampire murders?

171
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,870
I've heard something to the effect.

172
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,160
I'll get right to the point.

173
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Tatsuya, will you help us?

174
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,330
You two are aware that Saijo
from Class 1-E was attacked, right?

175
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,330
I'm not the only one who wants
to know what in the world is going on.

176
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,080
Even if we find the criminal
and hand them over,

177
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,160
this ordeal isn't over,
and we won't feel safe.

178
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,580
Do we have just one
perpetrator or is it a group?

179
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,660
Is this a personally motivated crime
or something infectious?

180
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,410
Until we have these answers,
we can't write it off as "case closed."

181
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:12,160
How much do you know about the situation?
How do you plan on solving it?

182
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Unless you tell me that, I can't help you.

183
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,490
If you promise to help us,
I'll tell you what we know.

184
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,120
Understood.

185
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,240
I'll help you.

186
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,410
Does that mean
you'll join our search team?

187
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,370
You may take it as such if you wish.

188
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,200
Roger.

189
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Then, I'll tell you
everything we know at this point.

190
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,870
I see.

191
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,620
Then, there are more
vampire victims than we thought.

192
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,830
Yes. We believe we're dealing
with multiple vampires.

193
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,240
Multiple?

194
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
That's bad news.

195
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,990
The expanded range special
investigation team from the police

196
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,200
is also helping us
track down the vampires,

197
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,700
but there's a third faction
interfering with our efforts.

198
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,950
Be careful of them, too.

199
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,370
Roger that.

200
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,950
So, what do you want me to do?

201
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,450
Would you accompany us?
If possible, from tonight--

202
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,660
No.

203
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,950
Shiba should work on his own.

204
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,910
If you find any clues, report them to us.

205
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,290
Understood.

206
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:52,330
It's so helpful that Major Kazama let us
use the stratospheric security camera.

207
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,830
Brother, are you going?

208
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,950
Be good and wait here for me.

209
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,910
I will await your return tonight.

210
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,240
I'll definitely need your help soon.

211
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,200
And when I do...

212
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,160
Yes. Then, we'll be together.

213
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,700
That's a promise, Brother.

214
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,990
Who could it be at this hour?

215
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,160
